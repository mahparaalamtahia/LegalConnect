## Technologies Used

- **React 18.2.0** - UI library
- **React Router DOM 6.20.0** - Routing
- **Axios 1.6.2** - HTTP client
- **CSS Modules** - Component-scoped styling

## Key Components

### Reusable Components
- **Header**: Navigation header with responsive menu
- **Footer**: Site footer with links and information
- **Sidebar**: Navigation sidebar for dashboards
- **Button**: Reusable button component with variants
- **Card**: Container component for content
- **StarRating**: Display star ratings
- **Timeline**: Visual timeline for case progress

### Pages
- **Home**: Landing page with hero section and services overview
- **Login/Register**: Authentication pages for clients and lawyers
- **LawyerSearch**: Search and filter lawyers

- **ClientDashboard**: Client dashboard with appointments and documents
- **LawyerDashboard**: Lawyer dashboard with appointments and profile
- **DocumentUpload**: Upload legal documents
- **Chat**: Real-time chat interface

## Styling

The application uses CSS Modules for component-scoped styling. Each component has its own `.module.css` file. The design is:
- Clean and modern
- Fully responsive (mobile and desktop)
- Uses a consistent color scheme
- Includes hover effects and transitions

## Authentication

The application uses localStorage to store authentication tokens. In a production environment, you should:
- Use secure HTTP-only cookies
- Implement proper token refresh
- Add route protection
- Validate tokens on the backend

## Sample Data

The application includes sample data for demonstration purposes. In a real application, this would come from your backend API.

## Development Notes

- All API calls use placeholder endpoints (`/api/...`)
- WebSocket functionality for chat is simulated with polling
- File upload uses FormData for multipart/form-data
- Forms include client-side validation
- Error handling is implemented for all API calls

## Future Enhancements

- Implement actual WebSocket connections for real-time chat
- Add route protection/guards
- Implement proper authentication flow
- Add loading states and skeletons
- Add toast notifications
- Implement pagination for lists
- Add search functionality enhancements
- Implement file preview functionality
